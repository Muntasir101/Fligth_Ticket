## Flight Cost Calculation System
This project implements a Flight Cost Calculation System that calculates the cost of flights based on distance, departure date, and service class. It provides accurate pricing for flights within different distance ranges and considers various factors such as departure date and service class.

## Features
Cost calculation for flights less than 500 miles: $100 flat rate.
Cost calculation for flights between 500 and 1000 miles:
Departing within 7 days: 10 cents per mile.
Departing within 30 days: 8 cents per mile.
Departing within 90 days: 6 cents per mile.
Cost calculation for flights over 1000 miles:
Departing within 7 days: 30 cents per mile.
Departing within 30 days: 25 cents per mile.
Departing within 90 days: 20 cents per mile.

## Service Class:
Economy class: Standard cost.
Business class: Double the cost.
First class: Triple the cost.
Additional Cost for Extra Baggage:
Flights less than 500 miles: No additional cost for extra baggage.
Flights between 500 and 1000 miles: $25 per kg.
Flights over 1000 miles: $50 per kg.

## Installation
[Provide installation instructions if applicable]

Usage
[Describe how to use the Flight Cost Calculation System]

Enter the flight distance.
Enter the departure date.
Select the desired service class (Economy, Business, or First).
Optionally, enter the weight of extra baggage.
Click on the "Calculate Cost" button.
The system will display the calculated cost for the flight.
Testing
The Flight Cost Calculation System has been thoroughly tested to ensure accurate cost calculations. The following testing techniques were employed:

## Equivalence Partitioning: 
Tests were designed to cover different equivalence classes for distance, departure date, and service class inputs.
Boundary Value Analysis: Tests were conducted using inputs at the boundaries of valid ranges to verify correct handling of edge cases.
Positive and Negative Testing: Tests were executed with both valid and invalid inputs to ensure proper error handling.
Regression Testing: Previously identified defects were retested to ensure they have been resolved and new changes haven't introduced regressions.
